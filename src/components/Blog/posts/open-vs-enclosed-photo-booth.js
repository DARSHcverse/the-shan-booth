  <p>When planning your next event, choosing the right <a href="/photoboothhiremelbourne">photo booth hire in Melbourne</a> can make a big difference in how your guests experience the fun. One of the first choices you’ll face is whether to go with an <strong>open-air photo booth</strong> or a <strong>traditional enclosed booth</strong>.</p>

  <h2>🎥 What Is an Open-Air Photo Booth?</h2>
  <p>An open-air booth is set up without walls — just a camera, lighting, and backdrop. It’s spacious, flexible, and perfect for larger groups. You can use creative <strong>custom backdrops</strong> or even your venue’s natural background.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>✅ Fits more people in a single shot</li>
    <li>✅ Great for weddings, birthdays, and corporate events</li>
    <li>✅ Easier to style with <a href="/photoboothhiremelbourne">custom backdrops</a> and props</li>
    <li>⚠️ Less private — guests are visible while posing</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📸 What Is an Enclosed Photo Booth?</h2>
  <p>An enclosed booth offers a private space with curtains or walls. It’s a nostalgic, old-school photo booth experience where guests can relax and be silly away from the crowd.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>✅ More privacy — perfect for shy guests</li>
    <li>✅ Controlled lighting for consistent photos</li>
    <li>✅ Classic photo strip look</li>
    <li>✅ Limited space — usually fits 3–5 people comfortably</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🤔 Which One Should You Choose?</h2>
  <p>The best option depends on your event type and vibe:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Weddings & Birthdays:</strong> Open-air booths let everyone join in on the fun.</li>
    <li><strong>Corporate Events:</strong> Open-air setups are great for branded backdrops and logos — check our <a href="/quickquote">Quick Quote page</a> for tailored packages.</li>
