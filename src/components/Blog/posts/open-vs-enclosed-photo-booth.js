  <p>When planning your next event, choosing the right <a href="/photoboothhiremelbourne">photo booth hire in Melbourne</a> can make a big difference in how your guests experience the fun. One of the first choices you‚Äôll face is whether to go with an <strong>open-air photo booth</strong> or a <strong>traditional enclosed booth</strong>.</p>

  <h2>üé• What Is an Open-Air Photo Booth?</h2>
  <p>An open-air booth is set up without walls ‚Äî just a camera, lighting, and backdrop. It‚Äôs spacious, flexible, and perfect for larger groups. You can use creative <strong>custom backdrops</strong> or even your venue‚Äôs natural background.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>‚úÖ Fits more people in a single shot</li>
    <li>‚úÖ Great for weddings, birthdays, and corporate events</li>
    <li>‚úÖ Easier to style with <a href="/photoboothhiremelbourne">custom backdrops</a> and props</li>
    <li>‚ö†Ô∏è Less private ‚Äî guests are visible while posing</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üì∏ What Is an Enclosed Photo Booth?</h2>
  <p>An enclosed booth offers a private space with curtains or walls. It‚Äôs a nostalgic, old-school photo booth experience where guests can relax and be silly away from the crowd.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>‚úÖ More privacy ‚Äî perfect for shy guests</li>
    <li>‚úÖ Controlled lighting for consistent photos</li>
    <li>‚úÖ Classic photo strip look</li>
    <li>‚úÖ Limited space ‚Äî usually fits 3‚Äì5 people comfortably</li>
  </ul>
